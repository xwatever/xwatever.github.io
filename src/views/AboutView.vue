      About me
      <div class="about">
        I live in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. I have learned coding for 10 years, and
        haven't started my career as a programmer yet. I want to start my
        journey as a Front-End Developer to make myself better at designing. I
        have learned to use Framework like Laravel, VueJS, ExpressJS for my
        college assignments. I strive for making something i have visualised
        works, but sometimes i'm just trying to make things simple if i dont
        have the capability for it. Things would've been better if i'm
        developing or creating more stuffs so i can improve my knowledge more.

          I was assigned as laboratory assistant for practicum study at certain
          subject. My role was to teach juniors to implement code that they have
          learned from lecturer at class, as well as assisting lecturer in
          evaluate student's grade based on their performance at practicum
          session and laboratory assignments. My concentration was Artificial
          Intelligent, and i'm intrigued by how math and some formulae have made
          something so complex.

          I learned coding for the first time here. Was taught basics of
          programming languages. It feels like magic when i tried to implement
          code to work, and felt like i'm doing some hacking stuff, LOL. Being
          intrigued by how software created, this is where i started to think
          "maybe, having a job as a programmer would be good for my future".
